# Covid-19 Impacts Analysis (Case Study)

<<<<<<< HEAD

## Overview

>>>>>>> 312ae306cd0db258bda3694f3a3ae2e896a63f6d
This project analyzes the spread of Covid-19 and its impact on the economy using Python. It utilizes data from Kaggle to explore the distribution of Covid-19 cases, deaths, and GDP per capita across different countries.

## Data Preparation

<<<<<<< HEAD
The dataset comprises two files: `transformed_data.csv` and `raw_data.csv`. The `transformed_data.csv` file contains aggregated data on daily cases, deaths, and stringency index. The `raw_data.csv` file contains detailed information on each country's COVID-19 cases and population.

## Analysis

### Spread of Covid-19:

- Visualized the top 10 countries with the highest number of Covid-19 cases using bar charts.
- Determined the death rate among the top 10 countries.
- Compared the total number of cases and deaths across the top 10 countries.

### Impact on Economy:

- Analyzed the GDP per capita before and during Covid-19 for the top 10 countries.
- Observed the impact of Covid-19 on GDP per capita using bar charts.
- Compared the GDP per capita before and during Covid-19 for each country individually.

### Other Factors:

- Inspected the stringency index, a measure of the stringency of government responses to Covid-19.
- Analyzed the Human Development Index (HDI), a composite index of life expectancy, education, and per capita income.

## Conclusion

The analysis revealed that the United States experienced the highest number of Covid-19 cases and deaths. Stringency measures and HDI played a significant role in the spread of the pandemic and its economic impact.
